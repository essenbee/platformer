A 2D Platform game developed using HaxeFlixel

The code in this repo was written live on-stream and is based upon the lengthy tutorial content of the e-book **Discover HaxeFlixel**, which can be purchased [here](http://discover-haxeflixel.com/). The graphics and audio assets are not included in this repo due to licencing restrictions, so you will need to provide your own after cloning (or buy the book).
